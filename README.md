# Project
This is the repository for the project of second semester, 'League Manager'. 

The project is basically a software that allows a person to easily manage a football league or football tournament that they are hosting by:
1. Determing the matches for the league or tournament.
2. Auto scheduling the matches(if needed).
3. Keeping up to date data of the league or tournament.
4. Displaying them in a simple, readable form which is also easily accessible
with the use of input data related to the league or tournament provided by the user that mostly includes team information and details of every match(like final score and goal scorers).
